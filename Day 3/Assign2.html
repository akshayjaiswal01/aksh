            Cricket is a popular outdoor game played in many parts of 
            the world on an international and national level. It is one 
            of the prominent games played in India by children and adults 
            alike.

            The game consists of two teams with 11 players each. The 
            game is played on a filed with a rectangular 22-yard long 
            pitch at the centre. There are wickets at the two ends. The 
            pitch is where the batsmen stand, and the bowler bowls the 
            ball. A coin toss takes place before the match begins. The 
            team captains do the coin toss. The captain that wins gets 
            to choose what they want to do first. Each team has to bat 
            and bowl. 2 batsmen are allowed on the field and try to 
            score a good amount of runs. The bowling team tries to bowl 
            them out to prevent this. A batsman can score a maximum of 6 
            runs in one ball. A bowler can bowl six balls in each over. 
            Umpires make sure that players follow the rules of the game. 
            There are two umpires on the field, one that stands on the 
            bowlerâ€™s end and another that stands on the square leg. 
            Nowadays there is a third umpire off the ground as well as 
            a match referee.

            The team that bats first sets a target score which the other
             side should chase down. If the team chases down the score, 
             they win. If the scores are tied, a final over called the 
             super over is played by the sides. The team that scores the 
             highest runs or chases down the target score wins. In case 
             of weather problems, then the match is either cancelled or 
             the Duckworth- Lewis method is adopted. Here the score of 
             the teams at last over that was played is compared. The 
             team with the highest runs wins.
